# Quick Repository Renaming Summary

## What You Need to Know

This is a **low-risk operation** because:
- ✅ Your website uses a custom domain (`muhack.org`)
- ✅ GitHub Pages will continue working after renaming
- ✅ GitHub automatically redirects old repository URLs
- ✅ Your website will remain accessible at `muhack.org`

## How to Rename Your Repository

### 1. On GitHub (Web Interface)
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/muhack/muhack.github.io`
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Repository name** section
4. Enter your new name (e.g., `muhack-website`)
5. Click **Rename**

### 2. Update Your Local Repository
After renaming on GitHub, run this command locally:
```bash
./update_remote.sh NEW_REPOSITORY_NAME
```

Or manually:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/muhack/NEW_REPOSITORY_NAME
```

### 3. Verify Everything Works
- Check that `muhack.org` still loads
- Verify GitHub Pages settings are intact
- Test that you can push/pull from the renamed repository

## Recommended Names
- `muhack-website`
- `muhack-site`  
- `website`
- `muhack.org`
